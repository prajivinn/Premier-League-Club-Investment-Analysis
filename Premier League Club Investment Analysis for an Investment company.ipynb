    "A renowned investment firm usually invest in top-tier sports teams that have potential. The dataset in their possession comprises crucial information about all the clubs that have participated in premier league (assume that it has the data for all clubs). It includes data on the number of goals scored, the number of times they have finished in the top two positions and other relevant details.\n",

    "The management of the firm aims to invest in one of the top-performing club in the English Premier League. To aid in their decision-making process, the analytics department has been tasked with creating a comprehensive report on the performance of various clubs. However, some of the more established clubs have already been owned by the competitors. As a result, the firm wishes to identify the clubs they can approach and potentially invest to ensure a successful and profitable deal."

    "According to my research, Blackburn Rovers were relegated to the Championship league in 2012 i.e., league below Premier League and later to League One in 2017 i.e., league below Championship league. However, they were promoted back to the Championship in 2018 and have since finished in the middle of the table in recent years. Given their inconsistent performance and lack of presence in the Premier League since 2012, it would be inappropriate to recommend this club for investment.\n",

    "On the other hand, Leicester City, the 2016 Premier League champions, have consistently finished in the top 10 in recent years. They placed 5th in both the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons and finished 8th in 2021-2022. With sufficient financial backing, Leicester City has the potential to achieve even greater success in the near future. Therefore, it would be reasonable to recommend Leicester City to our clients.\n",
